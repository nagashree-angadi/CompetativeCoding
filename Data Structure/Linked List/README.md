## Linked List

#### Advantages over arrays
1. Dynamic size
2. Ease of insertion/deletion

#### Drawbacks
1. Random access is not allowed.
2. The elements are not in contiguous locations, there is no locality of reference. Thus, not cache friendly.
3. Extra memory space for storing the pointer location with each element in the list.
